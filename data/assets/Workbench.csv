It can place tools and materials, and the drawer can store small parts or stationery. Its application scenarios include handicraft workstations in maker studios, simple assembly areas in small workshops, and home handicraft operation platforms. It can meet the bearing and storage needs during operations, improving operational convenience and space tidiness.
Visual Features: The main frame is yellow, matched with a light wood-colored tabletop and a turquoise drawer. The material combines metal (frame) and solid wood (tabletop). The surface treatment shows the solid texture of metal and the natural texture of solid wood. The color matching is lively and eye-catching, with high visual recognition against the black background. The overall design is both practical and somewhat decorative."
