Directionality: one-way
DNA: DC(a)","Functional Features: This object is an arc-shaped multi-layer conveyor belt system, functioning to steer and transfer materials in layers. It is used for efficient material steering and multi-layer diversion in scenarios like logistics sorting and electronic manufacturing, improving the material flow efficiency of production lines or warehouses. Its application scenarios include package steering and conveying in e-commerce sorting centers and multi-layer material distribution in auto parts production lines. It can meet the demand for one-way arc transmission, optimize space utilization and enhance transmission continuity.
Visual Features: The main body features a blue frame with a black conveyor belt and silver rollers. The material combines metal (frame, rollers) and rubber (conveyor belt), with a surface treatment that shows the solid texture of metal and the wear-resistant properties of rubber. The arc structure design is highly industrial against the black background, and the multi-layer layout highlights the rationality of space utilization and the efficiency of transmission."

DNA:DC(b)","Functional Features: This object is a straight roller conveyor belt, functioning to transmit materials in a straight and one-way manner. It is used for automated transportation of pallets and boxed goods in industrial production lines and warehousing logistics, and can connect upstream and downstream equipment to complete continuous material flow. Its application scenarios include parts transportation in electronic manufacturing lines and cargo transfer before sorting in e-commerce warehouses. It can efficiently handle linear transportation tasks of regular-shaped materials, improving the automated flow efficiency of production lines and warehouses.
Visual Features: The main body features a blue metal frame with silver rollers. The material combines metal (frame, rollers) and industrial plastic accessories, with a surface treatment that shows the solid luster of metal and the regular texture of components. The straight structure design is concise and practical, and the blue-silver color scheme against the black background highlights the professionalism and functionality of industrial equipment."
