DNA:DE(a)","Functional Features: This object is a double-layer industrial shelf, used to provide material storage space in scenarios such as warehousing and workshops. It can classify and place tools, components, finished products, etc. Its application scenarios include cargo storage in e-commerce warehouses, parts placement in automobile workshops, and material organization in small factories. It can effectively utilize vertical space, increase storage capacity and the convenience of material access, and help standardize the management of warehousing and production areas.
Visual Features: The main frame is in blue and red colors, and the shelves are dark gray. The material is metal (frame and shelves), and the surface treatment shows the solid texture of metal. The coating is uniform and has certain wear resistance. The structural design is concise and stable, and the double-layer layout is layered and distinct against the black background. The color matching highlights the practicality and recognizability of industrial equipment."
